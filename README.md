# Cpp_CS330

## Language Overview

###History
C++ was developed at Bells Laboratories by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Originally, C++ was known as “C with Classes” because it was created to add object-oriented programming to the language of C. In 1983, the name was changed to C++. The language became a commercial product in 1985, with its first compiler being Cfront. A few things C++ is used in are developing operating systems, browsers, applications, and game programming. 

##Getting Started
###Installation on MacOS
I used Visual Studio Code as my programming environment, but other environments that are good to run C++ in are Code::Blocks and Eclipse.
