# Cpp_CS330

## Language Overview

### History
C++ was developed at Bells Laboratories by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979. Originally, C++ was known as “C with Classes” because it was created to add object-oriented programming to the language of C. In 1983, the name was changed to C++. The language became a commercial product in 1985, with its first compiler being Cfront. A few things C++ is used in are developing operating systems, browsers, applications, and game programming. 

## Getting Started

### Installation on MacOS
I used Visual Studio Code as my programming environment, but other environments that are good to run C++ in are Code::Blocks and Eclipse. 

To install Visual Studio Code, use https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the one for your operating system. 

To run C++ on VSCode (Visual Studio Code) you will need to install a few extensions. Install the C/C++ and C/C++ Extension Pack by Microsoft. If you are still having trouble running C++, then also install an extension called Code Runner by Jun Han.
